Creating publication-quality figures
=====================================

`Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sf.net>`_ is a decent Python library
for creating publication-quality plots which offers a multitude of
different plot types. However, one limitation of ``matplotlib`` is that
creating complex layouts can be at times complicated. Therefore,
post-processing of plots is usually done in some other vector graphics
editor such as `inkscape <http://inkscape.org/>`_ or Adobe
Illustrator. The typical workflow is as following:

1. Import and analyse data in Python
#. Create figures in ``matplotlib``
#. Export  figures to PDF/SVG
#. Import figures to vector-graphics editor
#. Arrange and edit figures manually
#. Export the figure to PDF

As you probably see, the typical workflow is quite complicated. To
make things worse you may need to repeat the process several times,
when, for example, you want to include more data into the analysis.
This includes manual editing  and arranging the figure, which is
obviously time consuming.  Therefore it makes sense to try and
automate the process. Here, I will describe an automatic workflow
which completely resides on Python tools.

1. *Create plots*

   First you need to create nice matplotlib-based plots you would like
   to compose your figure from. You may download
   the scripts I will use in the example from github repository:
   `anscombe.py <https://github.com/btel/svg_utils/raw/master/docs/source/tutorial/anscombe.py>`_ and `sigmoid_fit.py <https://github.com/btel/svg_utils/raw/master/docs/source/tutorial/sigmoid_fit.py>`_.

   .. figure:: figures/sigmoid_fit.png
      :scale: 20 %

      ``sigmoid_fit.py``

   .. figure:: figures/anscombe.png
      :scale: 70 %

      ``anscombe.py``

2. *Export to SVG*

   A nice feature of matplotlib is that it allows to export figure to
   Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) which is an open  vector format [1]_
   understood by many applications (such as Inkscape, Adobe
   Illustrator or even web browsers). Not going too much into details,
   I will only say that SVG files are text files with special
   predefined tags (much alike HTML tags). You may try to open one of
   them in a text editor to find out what I mean.

3. *Arrange plots into composite figures*

   Now, we would like to combine both plots into one figure and add
   some annotations (such as one-letter labels: A,B, etc.). To this
   end, I will use a small Python package I wrote with this purpose
   ``svgutils``. It is written completely in Python and uses only
   standard libraries. You may download it from `github
   <https://github.com/btel/svg_utils>`_.

   The basic operations are similar to what you would do in a vector
   graphics editor, but instead of using a mouse you will do some
   scripting (I am sure you love it as much as I do). It may take some
   more time at the beginning, but with
   the advantage that you will not have to repeat the process when,
   for some reason, you need to modify the plots you generated
   with matplotlib (to add more data or modify the
   parameters of your analysis, just to name a few reasons).

   An example script is shown and explained below:

.. _transform-example-code:

   .. literalinclude:: scripts/fig_final.py

4. *Convert to PDF/PNG*

   After running the script, you may convert the output file to a
   format of your choice. To this end, you can use ``inkscape`` which
   can produce PNG and PDF files from SVG source. You can do that
   directly from command
   line without the need of opening the whole application::

      inkscape --export-pdf=fig_final.pdf fig_final.svg
      inkscape --export-png=fig_final.png fig_final.svg

   And here is the final result:

   .. figure:: figures/fig_final.png

      Final publication-ready figure.

Now, whenever you need to re-do the plots you can simply re-run the
above scripts. You can also automate the process by means of a build
system, such as GNU ``make`` or similar. This part will be covered in
some of the next tutorials from the series.

Good luck and happy plotting!

PS If you have a better/alternative method for creating your
publication plots, I would be very interested in learning about it.

.. [1] In case you do not know it, a vector format in contrast to other
   (raster) formats such as PNG, JPEG does not represent graphics as
   individual pixels, but rather as modifiable objects (lines, circles,
   points etc.). They usually offer better qualitiy for publication plots
   (PDF files are one of them) and are also editable.
